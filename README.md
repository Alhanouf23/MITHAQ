# 1- Introduction
This project aims to enhance employee promotion and training development by integrating machine learning (ML), specifically the Random Forest (RF) model, to improve decision-making in HR management. By addressing inefficiencies and biases in traditional HR processes, the system ensures fair, transparent, and data-driven employee evaluations. It also introduces training recommendations for non-promoted employees to support their professional growth.


**Key Features**

	•	Fair Employee Promotion Process – ML-driven predictions ensure unbiased and efficient promotions.
	•	Training Recommendations – Non-promoted employees receive training suggestions based on skill gaps.
	•	High Accuracy (94.23%) – Achieved through hyperparameter tuning, SMOTE, and data preprocessing.
	•	Monthly Reports – HR receives automated insights on employee performance.
	•	User-Friendly Interface – Developed with FastAPI and an interactive web-based frontend.
	•	Security & Authentication – OTP authentication is integrated for enhanced security.

# 2- Technologies Used

**Programming Languages & Libraries**

	•	Python – Core programming language for ML and backend.
	•	Pandas & NumPy – Data processing and analysis.
	•	Scikit-learn – ML model construction, testing, and improvement.
	•	SMOTE – Balancing the dataset by oversampling the minority class.
	•	HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Interactive UI/UX design.
	•	MySQL – Relational database for structured HR data.

**Tools & Technologies**

	•	FastAPI – Web framework for backend and API integration.
	•	GitHub – Version control and repository management.
	•	Kaggle – Dataset source and Jupyter Notebook environment.
	•	Microsoft Office Suite – Report documentation, analysis, and presentations.
	•	Figma – UI/UX prototyping for a seamless user experience.
	•	Lucidchart & Draw.io – Creating system flowcharts and data flow diagrams.
	•	Canva – Visual documentation and presentations.
	•	Google Forms – Collecting feedback and user inputs.
	•	Twilio API – For communication functionalities such as OTP verification.

**System Deployment & Installation**

**Requirements**

	•	Python 3.7 - 3.11
	•	MySQL Server
	•	Twilio API (for OTP authentication)
	•	Virtual Environment (for dependency isolation)

**Database Setup**

1. Download the provided .sql file from the project repository

2. Open config.py and update the DATABASE_URL with your MySQL username and password:

	DATABASE_URL = "mysql+pymysql://your_username:your_password@localhost/managementDB"


# 3- Installation Procedure
