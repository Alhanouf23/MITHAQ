# Leveraging Machine Learning to Optimize Human Resources Management: Employee Promotion and Training Development
  


This project aims to enhance employee promotion and training development by integrating machine learning (ML), specifically the Random Forest (RF) model, to improve decision-making in HR management. By addressing inefficiencies and biases in traditional HR processes, the system ensures fair, transparent, and data-driven employee evaluations. It also introduces training recommendations for non-promoted employees to support their professional growth.

Through MVC architecture, ER diagrams, and object-oriented design principles, the project ensures scalability and data integrity. Additionally, sequence diagrams, flowcharts, and black-box testing validate system goals and expected functionality.

Key Features
	•	Fair Employee Promotion Process – ML-driven predictions ensure unbiased and efficient promotions.
	•	Training Recommendations – Non-promoted employees receive training suggestions based on skill gaps.
	•	High Accuracy (94.23%) – Achieved through hyperparameter tuning, SMOTE, and data preprocessing.
	•	Monthly Reports – HR receives automated insights on employee performance.
	•	User-Friendly Interface – Developed with FastAPI and an interactive web-based frontend.
	•	Security & Authentication – OTP authentication is integrated for enhanced security.

System Deployment & Installation

Requirements
	•	Python 3.7 - 3.11
	•	MySQL Server
	•	Twilio API (for OTP authentication)
	•	Virtual Environment (for dependency isolation)

Database Setup
	1.	Open MySQL and create a database named mangmentDB:

CREATE DATABASE mangmentDB;


	2.	Modify the config.py file by updating the database path and password.

Installation Procedure

Step	macOS	Windows
1. Navigate to Project Directory	cd /your/path/to/the/project	cd /your/path/to/the/project
2. Create Virtual Environment	python3 -m venv venv	python3 -m venv venv
3. Activate Virtual Environment	source ./venv/bin/activate	.\venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install Dependencies	pip install -r requirements.txt	pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Launch System	python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload	python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Performance & Results

The model achieved 94.23% accuracy, outperforming previous research:
	•	81.15% accuracy in study [6]
	•	91.70% accuracy in study [7]

Key Optimization Techniques
	•	Hyperparameter tuning (number of trees, max depth, feature selection).
	•	Cross-validation to ensure model consistency.
	•	SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for data balancing.
	•	Robust data preprocessing to improve ML performance.

System Design & Architecture

	•	Reference [7]

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning-driven HR decision-making by:
	•	Enhancing accuracy and fairness in employee promotions.
	•	Providing actionable training recommendations for career development.
	•	Offering a user-friendly system that reduces HR workload.

Through data-driven insights, this system establishes a benchmark for transparent, objective, and optimized HR management.
