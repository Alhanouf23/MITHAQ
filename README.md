# Leveraging Machine Learning to Optimize Human Resources Management: Employee Promotion and Training Development
  


This project aims to enhance employee promotion and training development by integrating machine learning (ML), specifically the Random Forest (RF) model, to improve decision-making in HR management. By addressing inefficiencies and biases in traditional HR processes, the system ensures fair, transparent, and data-driven employee evaluations. It also introduces training recommendations for non-promoted employees to support their professional growth.


**Key Features**

	•	Fair Employee Promotion Process – ML-driven predictions ensure unbiased and efficient promotions.
	•	Training Recommendations – Non-promoted employees receive training suggestions based on skill gaps.
	•	High Accuracy (94.23%) – Achieved through hyperparameter tuning, SMOTE, and data preprocessing.
	•	Monthly Reports – HR receives automated insights on employee performance.
	•	User-Friendly Interface – Developed with FastAPI and an interactive web-based frontend.
	•	Security & Authentication – OTP authentication is integrated for enhanced security.
